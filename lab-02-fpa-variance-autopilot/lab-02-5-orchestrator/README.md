# Lab 2.5 — Create the FP&A Orchestrator Agent

**Duration:** 25 minutes  
**Prerequisite:** Labs 2.1 ✅ · 2.2 ✅ · 2.3 ✅ · 2.4 ✅  
**Reference:** [developer.watson-orchestrate.ibm.com](https://developer.watson-orchestrate.ibm.com)

---

## Goal

Build the **FP&A Variance Autopilot** as a multi-agent orchestrator. This agent does not call tools directly — it delegates to the three sub-agents you built in Labs 2.3 and 2.4, synthesises their outputs, and produces a single CFO-ready variance report.

By the end of this lab you will have:
- The `FP&A Variance Autopilot` orchestrator active in Orchestrate
- Three sub-agents wired: PA Data Agent · CRM Context Agent · ERP Context Agent
- A full end-to-end variance analysis running in under 5 minutes

---

## Background — Multi-Agent Pattern in watsonx Orchestrate

In Orchestrate, an orchestrator agent can call other agents as **collaborators** (in addition to or instead of tools). The orchestrator receives a high-level request, decides which sub-agent handles which part, passes sub-tasks to each one, and assembles the final answer.

```

    │       └── [PA MCP tools] ← TM1 / Planning Analytics
    │
    ├── crm_context_agent      ← "Get CRM context for DEPT-NA-SALES/2024-01"
    │       └── [CRM tools]    ← SalesLens CRM API
    │
    └── erp_context_agent      ← "Get ERP context for DEPT-NA-SALES/2024-01"
            └── [ERP tools]    ← SalesLens ERP API
```

The orchestrator then synthesises all three responses into one variance report.

## Step 1 — Confirm Sub-Agents Are Ready

Before creating the orchestrator, verify all three sub-agents are active:

1. In Orchestrate, navigate to **Agents**.
2. Confirm these agents show **Active** status:

| Agent name | Created in |
|-----------|-----------|
| `PA Data Agent` | Lab 2.3 |
| `CRM Context Agent` | Lab 2.4 |
| `ERP Context Agent` | Lab 2.4 |

> If any sub-agent is missing, complete the relevant lab before continuing.

---

## Step 2 — Create the Orchestrator Agent

### Option A — Orchestrate UI

1. Navigate to **Agents** → **Create agent**.
2. Fill in:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Name** | `FP&A Variance Autopilot` |
| **Description** | Multi-agent orchestrator. Coordinates PA Data Agent, CRM Context Agent, and ERP Context Agent to detect material budget variances in Planning Analytics, enrich with CRM/ERP root cause context, and produce a CFO-ready variance report with stakeholder routing. |
| **Model** | `ibm/granite-3-3-8b-instruct` (or tenant default) |

3. Click **Create**.

### Option B — ADK

```bash
orchestrate agents import \
  --file ./fpa-orchestrator-agent.yaml

# Verify
orchestrate agents list
# Expected: fpa_variance_autopilot   FP&A Variance Autopilot   active
```

---

## Step 3 — Import Orchestrator Instructions from YAML

1. In the agent editor → **Instructions** tab → **Import from YAML**.
2. Open [`fpa-orchestrator-agent.yaml`](fpa-orchestrator-agent.yaml) (in this folder) and paste.
3. Click **Apply**.

**Key orchestration logic sections to review:**

```
STEP 2 — Get PA data:
  Call pa_data_agent: "Return budget vs actual for [scope] in FPA_Variance for [period]"

STEP 3 — Route each material variance:
  IF account is REV-*    → call crm_context_agent
  IF account is OPEX-*   → call erp_context_agent
  IF account is COGS-*   → call erp_context_agent
  (Sub-agents can be called in parallel for multiple variances)

STEP 4 — Severity classification:
  HIGH:   > 25% or > $150,000
  MEDIUM: 15–25% or $75K–$150K
  LOW:    10–15% or $25K–$75K

STEP 6 — Stakeholder routing:
  HIGH → Regional VP / Dept Head (email, immediate)
  MEDIUM → FP&A Manager (dashboard)
  LOW → FP&A team (monthly summary)
```

---

## Step 4 — Add Sub-Agents as Collaborators

1. In the agent editor, go to the **Agents** tab (distinct from the Tools tab).
2. Click **Add agent** → select from the list of active agents.
3. Add all three:

```
✅ PA Data Agent
✅ CRM Context Agent
✅ ERP Context Agent
```

4. Click **Save**.

> **Note:** The orchestrator should have **no direct tools** from MCP or REST. All data flows through sub-agents. If your Orchestrate version does not yet have an Agents tab on the agent editor, see the ADK approach in Step 2 Option B — the `agents:` section in the YAML handles this.

---

## Step 5 — Run the End-to-End Autopilot

In the agent **Preview** / **Test** panel, send:

```
Run the FP&A variance analysis for January 2024 on the FPA_Variance cube
on the DemoGuide server. Identify all material variances, investigate root
causes using the CRM and ERP systems, and generate a full variance report.
```

### Watch the sub-agent call trace

In the **Trace** / **Steps** panel on the right, you should see:

```
Step 1 → pa_data_agent
         "Return budget vs actual for all depts in FPA_Variance for 2024-01"
         Result: variance table — 2 material variances flagged

Step 2 → crm_context_agent
         "Get CRM context for dept_id=DEPT-NA-SALES, period=2024-01, account_id=REV-001"
         Result: 2 slipped deals, $200K, context_summary returned

Step 3 → erp_context_agent
         "Get ERP context for dept_id=DEPT-NA-SALES, period=2024-01, account_id=OPEX-001"
         Result: 1 unbudgeted PO ($18K) + 1 HC event ($8K), context_summary returned

Step 4 → [Synthesise report]
```

Server: DemoGuide | Cube: FPA_Variance | Period: 2024-01
Sub-agents: pa_data_agent · crm_context_agent · erp_context_agent
Analysis time: 5.1 seconds

MATERIAL VARIANCES DETECTED: 2

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔴 HIGH — NA Sales | Enterprise Software Revenue
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Budget: $500,000 | Actual: $325,000
  Variance: -$175,000 (-35.0%) ← Unfavorable

  Root Cause: Two enterprise deals totalling $200K slipped from January
  to February. Acme Corp ($120K) delayed by customer procurement process;
  TechStart ($80K) impacted by client budget freeze. [source: CRM]

🟡 MEDIUM — NA Sales | Sales & Marketing OpEx
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Budget: $120,000 | Actual: $145,000
  Variance: +$25,000 (+20.8%) ← Unfavorable

  Root Cause: 1 unbudgeted PO ($18K — TechWorld Events trade show) +
  1 headcount event ($8K/mo — new Enterprise AE hire). [source: ERP]

  Classification: Controllable overspend
  Forecast Action: +$15K Q1 OpEx adjustment recommended

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
✅ FAVORABLE — EMEA Sales | Enterprise Software Revenue
  +$40,000 (+10.5%) — Early close of GlobalTech deal.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SUMMARY
  Revenue Variance (Net): -$135,000 (-8.8% vs budget)
  OpEx Variance (Net):    +$25,000  (+7.5% vs budget)
  Material Variances: 2 (1 High, 1 Medium)
  Coverage: 100% of material variances explained

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
  1. [HIGH]   Confirm Feb close — Acme Corp + TechStart (Sales VP)
  2. [MEDIUM] Review NA Sales OpEx run-rate for Q1 re-forecast (FP&A)
  3. [LOW]    Document EMEA early close in Q1 pipeline report

Confidence: 0.95 | Alerts: VP Sales (email), FP&A Manager (dashboard)
```

---

## Step 6 — Try Additional Periods

```
Run variance analysis for March 2024. Focus on APAC Sales.
```

Expected: `-$85K (-30.4%)` APAC revenue variance → CRM Agent returns Sino-Digital regulatory delay.

```
Run variance analysis for March 2025. Focus on Product Engineering.
```

Expected: `+$45K (+8.7%)` Prod Eng OpEx variance → ERP Agent returns NVIDIA GPU PO + ML contractor.

---

## Step 7 — Compare: Orchestrator vs Monolithic Agent (Optional)

The original `fpa-variance-agent.yaml` (in [`../assets/`](../assets/)) is a monolithic reference agent that holds all 15 tools directly. Compare:

| | Monolithic | Multi-agent |
|--|-----------|-------------|
| Tool count per agent | 15 | 3–10 (focused) |
| Sub-agent isolation | None | Full |
| Independent testability | No | Yes |
| Trace granularity | Tool-level | Agent + tool level |
| Failure isolation | Whole agent fails | Sub-agent fails, others continue |
| Add new data source | Edit one big agent | Add a new sub-agent |

---

## ✅ Checkpoint

Before moving to Lab 2.6 (optional), confirm:

- [ ] `FP&A Variance Autopilot` orchestrator shows **Active** in Orchestrate
- [ ] All 3 sub-agents appear under the **Agents** tab of the orchestrator
- [ ] Jan 2024 full autopilot produces a report with 2 material variances
- [ ] Trace shows sub-agent calls in the correct order
- [ ] Report includes `[source: CRM]` and `[source: ERP]` citations

---

## Troubleshooting

**Orchestrator calls tools directly instead of sub-agents**  
→ Verify no direct tools are added to the orchestrator — only sub-agents under the Agents tab.  
→ If tools were accidentally added, remove them and re-test.

**Sub-agent not available in the collaborator picker**  
→ The sub-agent must be in **Active** status. Check Agents list and re-activate if needed.  
→ Sub-agents must be in the same Orchestrate tenant and project.

**Orchestrator stops after PA data — does not call CRM/ERP**  
→ Review instructions: ensure routing logic is explicit:  
  `IF account type is Revenue (REV-*) → call crm_context_agent`  
→ Add to instructions: `Always call the appropriate context sub-agent for EVERY material variance before generating the final report. Never skip this step.`

**Report has low Confidence score**  
→ A sub-agent returned no data for one or more variances. Check the trace to see which call failed, then test that sub-agent independently.
