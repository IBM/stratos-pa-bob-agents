# Planning Analytics, Bob & watsonx Orchestrate Workshop

## AI-Powered Planning Experiences for FP&A Teams

---

This hands-on workshop demonstrates how **IBM Bob**, **IBM Planning Analytics (TM1)**, and **IBM watsonx Orchestrate** work together to build intelligent, AI-powered planning experiences. Participants will move from foundational concepts to working labs — finishing the day with practical skills they can apply to their own Finance & Planning use cases.

**Duration:** 6 hours (full day)
**Format:** Instructor-led with hands-on lab exercises
**Level:** Intermediate

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

- Understand how **watsonx Orchestrate** enables agentic workflows for enterprise finance
- Understand how **Bob** simplifies Planning Analytics development and analysis through conversational AI
- Configure a **Planning Analytics MCP connection** in Bob to interact with TM1 data using natural language
- Build and query a **TM1 cube** from CSV data using Bob's Planning Analytics mode
- Run a complete **FP&A Variance Autopilot** — detecting variances, investigating root causes across CRM and ERP systems, generating AI explanations, and routing stakeholder alerts
- Adapt the autopilot pattern to your own Planning Analytics scenario

## Featured Use Cases

### Use Case 1 — Bob + Planning Analytics via MCP
Bob uses the **Planning Analytics MCP integration** to interact with your TM1 environment through natural language. You can build TM1 models from CSV files, query cubes, perform variance analysis, detect outliers, and automate TurboIntegrator processes — all through conversation.

### Use Case 2 — FP&A Variance Autopilot
A **multi-agent watsonx Orchestrate system** monitors Planning Analytics for material budget variances (>$100K or >20%). When a variance is detected, the PA Data Agent retrieves the financial data, the CRM and ERP Context Agents investigate root causes from external systems, and the Orchestrator Agent synthesises a plain-language CFO-ready explanation and routes context-rich alerts to the right stakeholders — in under 5 minutes.
